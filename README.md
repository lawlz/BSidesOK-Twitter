# BSidesOK Twitter Bot

This is a concept to automate some of the functions of managing the twitter account for BSidesOK.

The initial goal is to be able to automatically retweet call for papers by other BSides orgs.  Then hopefully even retweet other BSides registration portals, especially the somewhat local ones...

TODO's are riddled and this code is a primitive start.  Please PR as you see fit, and I am sure I will gladly add it to this repo.  

It is sad now, help make it happy...
